# Exercise 1

Specify scenarios regarding Creditas Login website feature

## What have I done?

So, for this exercise I've chosen BDD as a software development process base. Then, I specified the behavior I expect from the application to be tested (Login feature).

For that, I used Gherkin language which is a very human language, very readable by any non-technical person, and the file may be used to implement code as well.

Besides, I focused on expected bahavior only. When implemented, these scenarios may be used as sanity tests to ensure the feature is not broken.

Fail scenarios were not considered once it is possible to get them through the expected behavior.

The file *specification.feature* may be sent to a development team and they will be guided much better.
